  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Cook rice according to package directions.  Once finished cooking remove from heat and keep lid on until ready to eat. Fluff with a fork before serving.
    <li>Pat tofu dry (you can press it if you like but that will take longer than 30 minutes) and cut into bite size pieces.  Heat a large pan over medium heat and add coconut oil, tofu and tamari or salt.  Stir, cover with a lid and let cook until browned, 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Add the garlic and all the vegetables and cook another 3 minutes.  Next, add the coconut milk, curry powder, garam masala and salt.  Stir everything together well, cover with a lid and let cook until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Divide rice into 4 equal portions and top with equal amounts of coconut curry.  Add any desired toppings you like and enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
