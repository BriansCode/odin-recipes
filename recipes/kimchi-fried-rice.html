  <h3>Forget ordinary fried rice! Kimchi fried rice is just as easy, but it packs a flavorful punch.</h3>
  <p>This is a great use for leftovers, too. You can freeze the fried rice for up to three months.</p>
  <p>When cooking your defrosted rice, add a little extra soy sauce so it doesn't dry out</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons canola oil, divided</li>
    <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 cup kimchi, coarsely chopped</li>

  </ul>
